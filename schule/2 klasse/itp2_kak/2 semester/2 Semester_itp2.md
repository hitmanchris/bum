## Transcrpit ding

0:00

Ladies and Gentlemen please welcome Mr Tim Minchin

0:03

(applause)

0:18

In darker days I did a corporate gig at a conference for this big company who made and

0:25

sold accounting software in a bid, I presumed, to inspire their salespeople to greater heights.

0:31

They'd forked out 12 grand for an inspirational speaker who was this extreme sports guy who

0:36

had had a couple of his limbs frozen off when he got stuck on a ledge on some mountain.

0:42

It was weird.

0:44

Software salespeople I think need to hear from someone who has had a long successful

0:49

career in software sales not from an overly optimistic ex-mountaineer.

0:55

Some poor guy who had arrived in the morning hoping to learn about sales techniques ended

0:59

up going home worried about the blood flow to his extremities. It's not inspirational,

1:05

it's confusing. And if the mountain was meant to be a symbol of life's challenges and the

1:09

loss of limbs a metaphor for sacrifice, the software guy is not going to get it, is he?

1:15

Because he didn't do an Arts degree, did he? He should have.

1:19

Arts degrees are awesome and they help you find meaning where there is none. And let

1:24

me assure you there is none. Don't go looking for it. Searching for meaning is like searching

1:31

for a rhymes scheme in a cookbook. You won't find it and it will bugger up your souffl√©.

1:38

If you didn't like that metaphor you won't like the rest of it.

1:46

Point being I'm not an inspirational speaker. I√≠ve never ever lost a limb on a mountainside

1:49

metaphorically or otherwise and I'm certainly not going to give career advice because, well

1:54

I've never really had what most would consider a job. However I have had large groups of

1:59

people listening to what I say for quite a few years now and it√≠s given me an inflated

2:03

sense of self importance.

2:04

So I will now, at the ripe old age of 37-point-nine, bestow upon you nine life lessons to echo

2:13

of course the nine lessons of carols of the traditional Christmas service, which is also

2:17

pretty obscure.

2:19

You might find some of this stuff inspiring. You will definitely find some of it boring

2:23

and you will definitely forget all of it within a week. And be warned there will be lots of

2:27

similes and obscure aphorisms which start well but end up making no sense. So listen

2:33

up or you'll get lost like a blind man clapping in a pharmacy trying to echo-locate the

2:38

contact lens fluid.

2:40

(audience laughs) - Looking for my old poetry teacher.

2:47

Here we go, ready?

2:50

One: You don't have to have a dream. Americans on talent shows always talk about their dreams.

2:56

Fine if you have something you've always wanted to do, dreamed of, like in your heart,

3:00

go for it. After all it's something to do with your time, chasing a dream. And if it's

3:04

a big enough one it'll take you most of your life to achieve so by the time you get to

3:08

it and are staring into the abyss of the meaningless of your achievement you'll be almost dead

3:14

so it won't matter.

3:16

I never really had one of these dreams and so I advocate passionate, dedication to the

3:21

pursuit of short-term goals. Be micro-ambitious. Put your head down and work with pride on

3:27

whatever is in front of you. You never know where you might end up. Just be aware the

3:31

next worthy pursuit will probably appear in your periphery, which is why you should be

3:36

careful of long-term dreams. If you focus too far in front of you you won't see the

3:40

shiny thing out the corner of your eye. Right? Good! Advice metaphor - look at me go.

3:47

Two: Don't seek happiness. Happiness is like an orgasm. If you think about it too much

3:53

it goes away. (audience laughs) Keep busy and aim to make someone else happy and you

4:04

might find you get some as a side effect. We didn't evolve to be constantly content.

4:09

Contented Homo erectus got eaten before passing on their genes.

4:13

Three: Remember it's all luck. You are lucky to be here. You are incalculably lucky to

4:21

be born and incredibly lucky to be brought up by a nice family who encouraged you to

4:26

go to uni. Or if you were born into a horrible family that's unlucky and you have my sympathy

4:31

but you are still lucky. Lucky that you happen to be made of the sort of DNA that went on

4:35

to make the sort of brain which when placed in a horrible child environment would make

4:39

decisions that meant you ended up eventually graduated uni. Well done you for dragging

4:44

yourself up by your shoelaces. But you were lucky. You didn't create the bit of you that

4:48

dragged you up. They're not even your shoelaces.

4:52

I suppose I worked hard to achieve whatever dubious achievements I've achieved but I

4:56

didn't make the bit of me that works hard any more than I made the bit of me that ate

5:03

too many burgers instead of attending lectures when I was here at UWA. Understanding that

5:08

you can't truly take credit for your successes nor truly blame others for their failures

5:13

will humble you and make you more compassionate. Empathy is intuitive. It is also something

5:18

you can work on intellectually.

5:20

Four: Exercise. I'm sorry you pasty, pale, smoking philosophy grads arching your eyebrows

5:28

into a Cartesian curve as you watch the human movement mob winding their way through the

5:33

miniature traffic cones of their existence. You are wrong and they are right. Well you're

5:38

half right. You think therefore you are but also you jog therefore you sleep therefore

5:42

you're not overwhelmed by existential angst. You can't be can't and you don't want to

5:47

be. Play a sport. Do yoga, pump iron, and run, whatever but take care of your body,

5:52

you're going to need it. Most of you mob are going to live to nearly 100 and even the

5:56

poorest of you will achieve a level of wealth that most humans throughout history could

5:59

not have dreamed of. And this long, luxurious life ahead of you is going to make you depressed.

6:06

(audience laughs) But don't despair. There is correlation between depression and exercise.

6:12

Do it! Run, my beautiful intellectuals run.

6:16

Five: Be hard on your opinions. A famous bon mot asserts opinions are like assholes in

6:24

that everyone has one. There is great wisdom in this but I would add that opinions differ

6:29

significantly from assholes in that yours should be constantly and thoroughly examined.

6:34

(audience laughs) I used to do exams in here (audience laughs) - It's revenge.

6:48

We must think critically and not just about the ideas of others. Be hard on your beliefs.

6:53

Take them out onto the verandah and hit them with a cricket bat. Be intellectually rigorous.

6:57

Identify your biases, your prejudices, your privileges. Most of society is kept alive

7:04

by a failure to acknowledge nuance. We tend to generate false dichotomies and then try

7:09

to argue one point using two entirely different sets of assumptions. Like two tennis players

7:15

trying to win a match by hitting beautifully executed shots from either end of separate

7:19

tennis courts.

7:21

By the way, while I have science and arts graduates in front of me please don't make

7:25

the mistake of thinking the arts and sciences are at odds with one another. That is a recent,

7:30

stupid and damaging idea. You don√≠t have to be unscientific to make beautiful art,

7:35

to write beautiful things. If you need proof - Twain, Douglas Adams, Vonnegut, McEwan,

7:41

Sagan and Shakespeare, Dickens for a start. You don't need to be superstitious to be

7:46

a poet. You don't need to hate GM technology to care about the beauty of the planet. You

7:50

don't have to claim a soul to promote compassion. Science is not a body of knowledge nor a belief

7:56

system it's just a term which describes human kinds' incremental acquisition of understanding

8:01

through observation. Science is awesome! The arts and sciences need to work together to

8:06

improve how knowledge is communicated. The idea that many Australians including our new

8:11

PM and my distant cousin Nick Minchin believe that the science of anthropogenic global warming

8:16

is controversial is a powerful indicator of the extent of our failure to communicate.

8:22

The fact that 30 percent of the people just bristled is further evidence still. (audience

8:26

laughs) The fact that that bristling is more to do with politics than science is even more

8:31

despairing.

8:32

Six: Be a teacher! Please! Please! Please be a teacher. Teachers are the most admirable

8:39

and important people in the world. You don't have to do it forever but if you're in doubt

8:43

about what to do be an amazing teacher. Just for your 20s be a teacher. Be a primary school

8:49

teacher. Especially if you're a bloke. We need male primary school teachers. Even if

8:54

you're not a teacher, be a teacher. Share your ideas. Don't take for granted your education.

9:00

Rejoice in what you learn and spray it.

9:04

Seven: Define yourself by what you love. I found myself doing this thing a bit recently

9:10

where if someone asks me what sort of music I like I say. Well I don't listen to the

9:14

radio because pop song lyrics annoy me, or if someone asks me what food I like I say,

9:18

I think truffle oil is overused and slightly obnoxious. And I see it all the time online

9:23

- people whose idea of being part of a subculture is to hate Coldplay or football or feminists

9:29

or the Liberal Party.

9:30

We have a tendency to define ourselves in opposition to stuff. As a comedian I make

9:35

my living out of it. But try to also express your passion for things you love. Be demonstrative

9:40

and generous in your praise of those you admire. Send thank you cards and give standing ovations.

9:45

Be pro stuff not just anti stuff.

9:49

Eight: Respect people with less power than you. I have in the past made important decisions

9:55

about people I work with agents and producers - big decisions based largely on how they

10:00

treat the wait staff in the restaurants we're having the meeting in. I don't care if you're

10:04

the most powerful cat in the room, I will judge you on how you treat the least powerful.

10:09

So there!

10:11

Nine: Finally, don't rush. You don't need to know what you're going to do with the

10:17

rest of your life. I'm not saying sit around smoking cones all day but also don't panic!

10:23

Most people I know who were sure of their career path at 20 are having mid-life crises

10:27

now.

10:30

I said at the beginning of this ramble, which is already three-and-a-half minutes long,

10:33

life is meaningless. It was not a flippant assertion. I think it√≠s absurd the idea of

10:38

seeking meaning in the set of circumstances that happens to exist after 13.8 billion years

10:44

worth of unguided events. Leave it to humans to think the universe has a purpose for them.

10:50

However I'm no nihilist. I'm not even a cynic. I am actually rather romantic and here√≠s

10:56

my idea of romance: you will soon be dead. Life will sometimes seem long and tough and

11:04

God it's tiring. And you will sometimes be happy and sometimes sad and then you'll be

11:09

old and then you√≠ll be dead. There is only one sensible thing to do with this empty existence

11:16

and that is fill it. Not fillet. Fill it. And in my opinion, until I change it, life

11:25

is best filled by learning as much as you can about as much as you can. Taking pride

11:29

in whatever you're doing. Having compassion, sharing ideas, running, being enthusiastic

11:36

and then there's love and travel and wine and sex and art and kids and giving and mountain

11:41

climbing, but you know all that stuff already. It√≠s an incredibly exciting thing this one

11:47

meaningless life of yours. Good luck and thank you for indulging me.
